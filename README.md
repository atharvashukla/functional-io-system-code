        Functional programming languages ought to play a central role in
        mathematics education for middle schools (age range: 10-14). After all,
        functional programming is a form of algebra and programming is a
        creative activity about problem solving. Introducing it into
        mathematics courses would make pre-algebra course come alive. If input
        and output were invisible, students could implement fun simulations,
        animations, and even interactive and distributed games all while using
        nothing more than plain mathematics. We have implemented this vision
        with a simple framework for purely functional I/O. Using this
        framework, students design, implement, and test plain mathematical
        functions over numbers, booleans, string, and images. Then the
        framework wires them up to devices and performs all the translation
        from external information to internal data (and vice versa)--just like
        every other operating system. Once middle school students are hooked on
        this form of programming, our curriculum provides a smooth path for
        them from pre-algebra to freshman courses in college on object-oriented
        design and theorem proving.
